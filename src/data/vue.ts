export const vueQuestions:Question[] = [{"question": "1.  ### What is VueJS?", "answer": "**Vue.js** is an open-source, progressive Javascript framework for building user interfaces that aim to be incrementally adoptable. The core library of VueJS is focused on the `view layer` only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.", "code": ""}, {"question": "2.  ### What are the major features of VueJS?", "answer": "Below are the some of major features available with VueJS1. **Virtual DOM:** It uses virtual DOM similar to other existing frameworks such as ReactJS, Ember etc. Virtual DOM is a light-weight in-memory tree representation of the original HTML DOM and updated without affecting the original DOM.2. **Components:** Used to create reusable custom elements in VueJS applications.3. **Templates:** VueJS provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data4. **Routing:** Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router5. **Light weight:** VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.", "code": ""}, {"question": "3.  ### What are the lifecycle methods of VueJS?", "answer": "Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you\u2019re using works behind-the-scenes. By using these hooks, you will know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed. Let's look at lifecycle diagram before going to each lifecycle hook in detail,<img src=\"https://github.com/sudheerj/vuejs-interview-questions/blob/master/images/lifecycle.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"800\">1. **Creation(Initialization):**Creation Hooks allow you to perform actions before your component has even been added to the DOM. You need to use these hooks if you need to set things up in your component both during client rendering and server rendering. Unlike other hooks, creation hooks are also run during server-side rendering.1. beforeCreate:This hook runs at the very initialization of your component. hook observes data and initialization events in your component. Here, data is still not reactive and events that occur during the component\u2019s lifecycle have not been set up yet.", "code": "new Vue((data: (count: 10),beforeCreate: function () (console.log('Nothing gets called at this moment')// `this` points to the view model instanceconsole.log('count is ' + this.count);)))// count is undefined2. created:This hook is invoked when Vue has set up events and data observation. Here, events are active and access to reactive data is enabled though templates have not yet been mounted or rendered.new Vue((data: (count: 10),created: function () (// `this` points to the view model instanceconsole.log('count is: ' + this.count))))// count is: 10**Note:** Remember that, You will not have access to the DOM or the target mounting element (this.$el) inside of creation hooks2. **Mounting(DOM Insertion):**Mounting hooks are often the most-used hooks and they allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render.1. beforeMount:The beforeMount allows you to access your component immediately before and after the first render.new Vue((beforeMount: function () (// `this` points to the view model instanceconsole.log(`this.$el is yet to be created`);)))2. mounted:This is a most used hook and you will have full access to the reactive component, templates, and rendered DOM (via. this.$el).  The most frequently used patterns are fetching data for your component.<div id=\"app\"><p>I\u2019m text inside the component.</p></div>new Vue((el: \u2018#app\u2019,mounted: function() (console.log(this.$el.textContent); // I'm text inside the component.)))3. **Updating (Diff & Re-render):**Updating hooks are called whenever a reactive property used by your component changes, or something else causes it to re-render1. beforeUpdate:The beforeUpdate hook runs after data changes on your component and the update cycle begins, right before the DOM is patched and re-rendered.<div id=\"app\"><p>((counter))</p></div>...// rest of the codenew Vue((el: '#app',data() (return (counter: 0)),created: function() (setInterval(() => (this.counter++), 1000)),beforeUpdate: function() (console.log(this.counter) // Logs the counter value every second, before the DOM updates.)))2. updated:This hook runs after data changes on your component and the DOM re-renders.<div id=\"app\"><p ref=\"dom\">((counter))</p></div>...//new Vue((el: '#app',data() (return (counter: 0)),created: function() (setInterval(() => (this.counter++), 1000)),updated: function() (console.log(+this.$refs['dom'].textContent === this.counter) // Logs true every second)))4. **Destruction (Teardown):**Destruction hooks allow you to perform actions when your component is destroyed, such as cleanup or analytics sending.1. beforeDestroy:`beforeDestroy` is fired right before teardown. If you need to cleanup events or reactive subscriptions, beforeDestroy would probably be the time to do it. Your component will still be fully present and functional.new Vue ((data() (return (message: 'Welcome VueJS developers')),beforeDestroy: function() (this.message = nulldelete this.message)))2. destroyed:This hooks is called after your component has been destroyed, its directives have been unbound and its event listeners have been removed.new Vue ((destroyed: function() (console.log(this) // Nothing to show here)))"}, {"question": "4.  ### What are the conditional directives?", "answer": "", "code": "VueJS provides set of directives to show or hide elements based on conditions. The available directives are: **v-if, v-else, v-else-if and v-show****1. v-if:**  The v-if directive adds or removes DOM elements based on the given expression. For example, the below button will not show if isLoggedIn is set to false.<button v-if=\"isLoggedIn\">Logout</button>You can also control multiple elements with a single v-if statement by wrapping all the elements in a `<template>` element with the condition. For example, you can have both label and button together conditionally applied,<template v-if=\"isLoggedIn\"><label> Logout </button><button> Logout </button></template>**2. v-else:**  This directive is used to display content only when the expression adjacent v-if resolves to false. This is similar to else block in any programming language to display alternative content and it is preceded by v-if or v-else-if block. You don't need to pass any value to this.For example, v-else is used to display LogIn button if isLoggedIn is set to false(not logged in).<button v-if=\"isLoggedIn\"> Logout </button><button v-else> Log In </button>**3. v-else-if:** This directive is used when we need more than two options to be checked.For example, we want to display some text instead of LogIn button when ifLoginDisabled property is set to true. This can be achieved through v-else statement.<button v-if=\"isLoggedIn\"> Logout </button><label v-else-if=\"isLoginDisabled\"> User login disabled </label><button v-else> Log In </button>**4. v-show:** This directive is similar to v-if but it renders all elements to the DOM and then uses the CSS display property to show/hide elements. This directive is recommended if the elements are switched on and off frequently.<span v-show=\"user.name\">Welcome user,((user.name))</span>"}, {"question": "5.  ### What is the difference between v-show and v-if directives?", "answer": "", "code": "Below are some of the main differences between **v-show** and **v-if** directives,1. v-if only renders the element to the DOM if the expression passes whereas v-show renders all elements to the DOM and then uses the CSS display property to show/hide elements based on expression.2. v-if supports v-else and v-else-if directives whereas v-show doesn't support else directives.3. v-if has higher toggle costs while v-show has higher initial render costs. i.e, v-show has a performance advantage if the elements are switched on and off frequently, while the v-if has the advantage when it comes to initial render time.4. v-if supports `<template>` tab but v-show doesn't support."}, {"question": "6.  ### What is the purpose of v-for directive?", "answer": "", "code": "The built-in v-for directive allows us to loop through items in an array or object. You can iterate on each element in the array or object.1. **Array usage:**<ul id=\"list\"><li v-for=\"(item, index) in items\">(( index )) - (( item.message ))</li></ul>var vm = new Vue((el: '#list',data: (items: [( message: 'John' ),( message: 'Locke' )])))You can also use `of` as the delimiter instead of `in`, similar to javascript iterators.2. **Object usage:**<div id=\"object\"><div v-for=\"(value, key, index) of user\">(( index )). (( key )): (( value ))</div></div>var vm = new Vue((el: '#object',data: (user: (firstName: 'John',lastName: 'Locke',age: 30))))"}, {"question": "7.  ### What is vue instance?", "answer": "", "code": "Every Vue application works by creating a new Vue instance with the Vue function. Generally the variable vm (short for ViewModel) is used to refer Vue instance. You can create vue instance as below,var vm = new Vue((// options))As mentioned in the above code snippets, you need to pass options object. You can find the full list of options in the API reference."}, {"question": "8.  ### How do you achieve conditional group of elements?", "answer": "", "code": "You can achieve conditional group of elements(toggle multiple elements at a time) by applying **v-if** directive on `<template>` element which works as invisible wrapper(no rendering) for group of elements.For example, you can conditionally group user details based on valid user condition.<template v-if=\"condition\"><h1>Name</h1><p>Address</p><p>Contact Details</p></template>"}, {"question": "9.  ### How do you reuse elements with key attribute?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue always tries to render elements as efficient as possible. So it tries to reuse the elements instead of building them from scratch. But this behavior may cause problems in few scenarios.For example, if you try to render the same input element in both `v-if` and `v-else` blocks then it holds the previous value as below,<template v-if=\"loginType === 'Admin'\"><label>Admin</label><input placeholder=\"Enter your ID\"></template><template v-else><label>Guest</label><input placeholder=\"Enter your name\"></template>In this case, it shouldn't reuse. We can make both input elements as separate by applying **key** attribute as below,<template v-if=\"loginType === 'Admin'\"><label>Admin</label><input placeholder=\"Enter your ID\" key=\"admin-id\"></template><template v-else><label>Guest</label><input placeholder=\"Enter your name\" key=\"user-name\"></template>The above code make sure both inputs are independent and doesn't impact each other."}, {"question": "10. ### Why should not use if and for directives together on the same element?", "answer": "", "code": "It is recommended not to use v-if on the same element as v-for. Because v-if directive has a higher priority than v-for.There are two cases where developers try to use this combination,1. To filter items in a listFor example, if you try to filter the list using v-if tag,<ul><liv-for=\"user in users\"v-if=\"user.isActive\":key=\"user.id\">(( user.name ))<li></ul>This can be avoided by preparing the filtered list using computed property on the initial listcomputed: (activeUsers: function () (return this.users.filter(function (user) (return user.isActive))))...... //...... //<ul><liv-for=\"user in activeUsers\":key=\"user.id\">(( user.name ))<li></ul>2. To avoid rendering a list if it should be hiddenFor example, if you try to conditionally check if the user is to be shown or hidden<ul><liv-for=\"user in users\"v-if=\"shouldShowUsers\":key=\"user.id\">(( user.name ))<li></ul>This can be solved by moving the condition to a parent by avoiding this check for each user<ul v-if=\"shouldShowUsers\"><liv-for=\"user in users\":key=\"user.id\">(( user.name ))<li></ul>"}, {"question": "11.  ### Why do you need to use key attribute on for directive?", "answer": "", "code": "In order to track each node\u2019s identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique `key` attribute for each item with in `v-for` iteration. An ideal value for key would be the unique id of each item.Let us take an example usage,<div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\">((item.name))</div>Hence, It is always recommended to provide a key with v-for whenever possible, unless the iterated DOM content is simple.**Note:** You shouldn\u2019t use non-primitive values like objects and arrays as v-for keys. Use string or numeric values instead."}, {"question": "12.  ### What are the array detection mutation methods?", "answer": "", "code": "As the name suggests, mutation methods modifies the original array.Below are the list of array mutation methods which trigger view updates.1. push()2. pop()3. shift()4. unshift()5. splice()6. sort()7. reverse()If you perform any of the above mutation method on the list then it triggers view update. For example, push method on array named 'items' trigger a view update,vm.todos.push(( message: 'Baz' ))"}, {"question": "13.  ### What are the array detection non-mutation methods?", "answer": "", "code": "The methods which do not mutate the original array but always return a new array are called non-mutation methods.Below are the list of non-mutation methods,1. filter()2. concat()3. slice()For example, lets take a todo list where it replaces the old array with new one based on status filter,vm.todos = vm.todos.filter(function (todo) (return todo.status.match(/Completed/)))This approach won't re-render the entire list due to VueJS implementation."}, {"question": "14.  ### What are the caveats of array changes detection?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue cannot detect changes for the array in the below two cases,1. When you directly set an item with the index,For example,vm.todos[indexOfTodo] = newTodo2. When you modify the length of the array, For example,vm.todos.length = todosLengthYou can overcome both the caveats using `set` and `splice` methods, Let's see the solutions with an examples,**First use case solution**// Vue.setVue.set(vm.todos, indexOfTodo, newTodoValue)(or)// Array.prototype.splicevm.todos.splice(indexOfTodo, 1, newTodoValue)**Second use case solution**vm.todos.splice(todosLength)"}, {"question": "15.  ### What are the caveats of object changes detection?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue cannot detect changes for the object in property addition or deletion.Lets take an example of user data changes,var vm = new Vue((data: (user: (name: 'John'))))// `vm.name` is now reactivevm.user.email = john@email.com // `vm.user.email` is NOT reactiveYou can overcome this scenario using the Vue.set(object, key, value) method or Object.assign(),Vue.set(vm.user, 'email', 'john@email.com');// (or)vm.user = Object.assign((), vm.user, (email: john@email.com))"}, {"question": "16.  ### How do you use v-for directive with a range?", "answer": "", "code": "You can also use integer type(say 'n') for `v-for` directive which repeats the element many times.<div><span v-for=\"n in 20\">(( n )) </span></div>It displays the number 1 to 20."}, {"question": "17.  ### How do you use v-for directive on template?", "answer": "", "code": "Just similar to v-if directive on template, you can also use a `<template>` tag with v-for directive to render a block of multiple elements.Let's take a todo example,<ul><template v-for=\"todo in todos\"><li>(( todo.title ))</li><li class=\"divider\"></li></template></ul>"}, {"question": "18.  ### How do you use event handlers?", "answer": "", "code": "You can use event handlers in vue similar to plain javascript. The method calls also support the special $event variable.<button v-on:click=\"show('Welcome to VueJS world', $event)\">Submit</button>methods: (show: function (message, event) (// now we have access to the native eventif (event) event.preventDefault()console.log(message);))"}, {"question": "19.  ### What are the event modifiers provided by vue?", "answer": "", "code": "Normally, javascript provides `event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation()` inside event handlers. You can use methods provided by vue, but these methods are meant for data logic instead of dealing with DOM events. Vue provides below event modifiers for v-on and these modifiers are directive postfixes denoted by a dot.1. .stop2. .prevent3. .capture4. .self5. .once6. .passiveLet's take an example of stop modifier,<!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped --><a v-on:click.stop=\"methodCall\"></a>You can also chain modifiers as below,<!-- modifiers can be chained --><a v-on:click.stop.prevent=\"doThat\"></a>"}, {"question": "20.  ### What are key modifiers?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue supports key modifiers on `v-on` for handling keyboard events. Let's take an example of keyup event with enter keycode.<!-- only call `vm.show()` when the `keyCode` is 13 --><input v-on:keyup.13=\"show\">Remembering all the key codes is really difficult. It supports the full list of key codes aliases1. .enter2. .tab3. .delete (captures both \u201cDelete\u201d and \u201cBackspace\u201d keys)4. .esc5. .space6. .up7. .down8. .left9. .rightNow the above keyup code snippet can be written with aliases as follows,<input v-on:keyup.enter=\"submit\" /><!-- OR with shorthand notation --><input @keyup.enter=\"submit\" />**Note:** The use of keyCode events is deprecated and may not be supported in new browsers."}, {"question": "21.  ### How do you define custom key modifier aliases?", "answer": "", "code": "You can define custom key modifier aliases via the global `config.keyCodes`. There are few guidelines for the properties1. You can't use camelCase. Instead you can use kebab-case with double quotation marks2. You can define multiple values in an array formatVue.config.keyCodes = (f1: 112,\"media-play-pause\": 179,down: [40, 87])"}, {"question": "22.  ### What are the supported System Modifier Keys?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue supports below modifiers to trigger mouse or keyboard event listeners when the corresponding key is pressed,1. .ctrl2. .alt3. .shift4. .metaLets take an example of control modifier with click event,<!-- Ctrl + Click --><div @click.ctrl=\"doSomething\">Do something</div>"}, {"question": "23.  ### What are the supported Mouse Button Modifiers?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue supports below mouse button modifiers1. .left2. .right3. .middleFor example, the usage of `.right` modifier as below<buttonv-if=\"button === 'right'\"v-on:mousedown.right=\"increment\"v-on:mousedown.left=\"decrement\"/>"}, {"question": "24.  ### How do you implement two-way binding?", "answer": "", "code": "You can use the `v-model` directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements.Lets take an example of it using input component,<input v-model=\"message\" placeholder=\"Enter input here\"><p>The message is: (( message ))</p>Remember, v-model will ignore the initial `value`, `checked` or `selected` attributes found on any form elements. So it always use the Vue instance data as the source of truth."}, {"question": "25.  ### What are the supported modifiers on model?", "answer": "", "code": "There are three modifiers supported for v-model directive.**1. lazy:** By default, v-model syncs the input with the data after each input event. You can add the lazy modifier to instead sync after change events.<!-- synced after \"change\" instead of \"input\" --><input v-model.lazy=\"msg\" >**2. number:** If you want user input to be automatically typecast as a number, you can add the number modifier to your v-model. Even with type=\"number\", the value of HTML input elements always returns a string. So, this typecast modifier is required.<input v-model.number=\"age\" type=\"number\">**3. trim:** If you want whitespace from user input to be trimmed automatically, you can add the trim modifier to your v-model.<input v-model.trim=\"msg\">"}, {"question": "26.  ### What are components and give an example?", "answer": "", "code": "Components are reusable Vue instances with a name. They accept the same options as new Vue, such as data, computed, watch, methods, and lifecycle hooks(except few root-specific options like el).Lets take an example of counter component,// Define a new component called button-counterVue.component('button-counter', (template: '<button v-on:click=\"count++\">You clicked me (( count )) times.</button>'data: function () (return (count: 0)),))Let's use this component inside a root Vue instance created with new Vue<div id=\"app\"><button-counter></button-counter></div>var vm = new Vue(( el: '#app' ));"}, {"question": "27.  ### What are props?", "answer": "", "code": "Props are custom attributes you can register on a component. When a value is passed to a prop attribute, it becomes a property on that component instance. You can pass those list of values as props option and use them as similar to data variables in template.Vue.component('todo-item', (props: ['title'],template: '<h2>(( title ))</h2>'))Once the props are registered, you can pass them as custom attributes.<todo-item title=\"Learn Vue conceptsnfirst\"></todo-item>"}, {"question": "28.  ### When component needs a single root element?", "answer": "", "code": "In VueJS 2.x, every component must have a single root element **when template has more than one element**. In this case, you need to wrap the elements with a parent element.<template><div class=\"todo-item\"><h2>(( title ))</h2><div v-html=\"content\"></div></div></template>Otherwise there will an error throwing, saying that \"Component template should contain exactly one root element...\".Whereas in 3.x, components now can have multiple root nodes. This way of adding multiple root nodes is called as fragments.<template><h2>(( title ))</h2><div v-html=\"content\"></div></template>"}, {"question": "29.  ### How do you communicate from child to parent using events?", "answer": "", "code": "If you want child wants to communicate back up to the parent, then emit an event from child using `$emit` object to parent,Vue.component('todo-item', (props: ['todo'],template: `<div class=\"todo-item\"><h3>(( todo.title ))</h3><button v-on:click=\"$emit('increment-count', 1)\">Add</button><div v-html=\"todo.description\"></div></div>`))Now you can use this todo-item in parent component to access the count value.<ul v-for=\"todo in todos\"><li><todo-itemv-bind:key=\"todo.id\"v-bind:todo=\"todo\"v-on:increment-count=\"total += 1\"/></todo-item></li></ul><span> Total todos count is ((total))</span>"}, {"question": "30.  ### How do you implement model on custom input components?", "answer": "", "code": "The custom events can also be used to create custom inputs that work with v-model. The `<input>` inside the component must follow below rules,1. Bind the value attribute to a value prop2. On input, emit its own custom input event with the new value.Let's take a custom-input component as an example,Vue.component('custom-input', (props: ['value'],template: `<inputv-bind:value=\"value\"v-on:input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)\"/>`))Now you can use `v-model` with this component,<custom-input v-model=\"searchInput\"></custom-input>"}, {"question": "31.  ### What are slots?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue implements a content distribution API using the <slot> element to serve as distribution outlets for content created after the current Web Components spec draft.Let's create an alert component with slots for content insertion,Vue.component('alert', (template: `<div class=\"alert-box\"><strong>Error!</strong><slot></slot></div>`))Now you can insert dynamic content as below,<alert>There is an issue with in application.</alert>"}, {"question": "32.  ### What is global registration in components?", "answer": "", "code": "The components which are globally registered can be used in the template of any root Vue instance (new Vue) created after registration.In the global registration, the components created using Vue.component as below,Vue.component('my-component-name', (// ... options ...))Let's take multiple components which are globally registered in the vue instance,Vue.component('component-a', ( /* ... */ ))Vue.component('component-b', ( /* ... */ ))Vue.component('component-c', ( /* ... */ ))new Vue(( el: '#app' ))The above components can be used in the vue instance,<div id=\"app\"><component-a></component-a><component-b></component-b><component-c></component-c></div>Remember that the components can be used in subcomponents as well."}, {"question": "33.  ### Why do you need local registration?", "answer": "", "code": "Due to global registration, even if you don't use the component it could still be included in your final build. So it will create unnecessary javascript in the application. This can be avoided using local registration with the below steps,1. First you need to define your components as plain JavaScript objectsvar ComponentA = ( /* ... */ )var ComponentB = ( /* ... */ )var ComponentC = ( /* ... */ )Locally registered components will not be available in sub components. In this case, you need to add them in components sectionvar ComponentA = ( /* ... */ )var ComponentB = (components: ('component-a': ComponentA),// ...)2. You can use the components in the components section of the vue instance,new Vue((el: '#app',components: ('component-a': ComponentA,'component-b': ComponentB)))"}, {"question": "34.  ### What is the difference between local and global registration in module system?", "answer": "", "code": "In **local registration**, you need to create each component in components folder(optional but it is recommended) and import them in another component file components section.Let's say you want to register component A and B in component C, the configuration seems as below,import ComponentA from './ComponentA'import ComponentB from './ComponentB'export default (components: (ComponentA,ComponentB),// ...)Now both ComponentA and ComponentB can be used inside ComponentC\u2018s template.In **global registration**, you need to export all common or base components in a separate file. But some of the popular bundlers like `webpack` make this process simpler by using `require.context` to globally register base components in the below entry file(one-time).import Vue from 'vue'import upperFirst from 'lodash/upperFirst'import camelCase from 'lodash/camelCase'const requireComponent = require.context(// The relative path of the components folder'./components',// Whether or not to look in subfoldersfalse,// The regular expression used to match base component filenames/Base[A-Z]\\w+\\.(vue|js)$/)requireComponent.keys().forEach(fileName => (// Get component configconst componentConfig = requireComponent(fileName)// Get PascalCase name of componentconst componentName = upperFirst(camelCase(// Strip the leading `./` and extension from the filenamefileName.replace(/^\\.\\/(.*)\\.\\w+$/, '$1')))// Register component globallyVue.component(componentName,// Look for the component options on `.default`, which will// exist if the component was exported with `export default`,// otherwise fall back to module's root.componentConfig.default || componentConfig)))"}, {"question": "35.  ### What are possible prop types?", "answer": "", "code": "You can declare props with type or without type. But it is recommended to have prop types because it provides the documentation for the component and warns the developer for any incorrect data type being assigned.props: (name: String,age: Number,isAuthenticated: Boolean,phoneNumbers: Array,address: Object)As mentioned in the above code snippet, you can list props as an object, where the properties\u2019 names and values contain the prop names and types, respectively."}, {"question": "36.  ### What is the data flow followed by props?", "answer": "", "code": "All props follows a one-way-down binding between the child property and the parent one. i.e, When the parent property is updated then that latest prop value will be passed down to the child, but not the otherway(child to parent) around. The child component should not mutate the prop otherwise it throws a warning in the console.The possible mutation cases can be solved as below,1. When you try to use parent prop as initial value for child property:In this case you can define a local property in child component and assign parent value as initial valueprops: ['defaultUser'],data: function () (return (username: this.defaultUser))2. When you try to transform the parent prop:You can define a computed property using the prop\u2019s value,props: ['environment'],computed: (localEnvironment: function () (return this.environment.trim().toUpperCase()))"}, {"question": "37.  ### What are non prop attributes?", "answer": "", "code": "A non-prop attribute is an attribute that is passed to a component, but does not have a corresponding prop defined.For example, If you are using a 3rd-party custom-input component that requires a `data-tooltip` attribute on the input then you can add this attribute to component instance,<custom-input data-tooltip=\"Enter your input\" />If you try to pass the props from parent component the child props with the same names will be overridden. But props like `class` and `style` are exception to this, these values will be merged in the child component.<!-- Child component --><input type=\"date\" class=\"date-control\"><!-- Parent component --><custom-input class=\"custom-class\" />"}, {"question": "38.  ### Describe about validations available for props?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue provides validations such as types, required fields, default values along with customized validations. You can provide an object with validation requirements to the value of props as below,Let's take an example of user profile Vue component with possible validations,Vue.component('user-profile', (props: (// Basic type check (`null` matches any type)age: Number,// Multiple possible typesidentityNumber: [String, Number],// Required stringemail: (type: String,required: true),// Number with a default valueminBalance: (type: Number,default: 10000),// Object with a default valuemessage: (type: Object,// Object or array defaults must be returned from// a factory functiondefault: function () (return ( message: 'Welcome to Vue' ))),// Custom validator functionlocation: (validator: function (value) (// The value must match one of these stringsreturn ['India', 'Singapore', 'Australia'].indexOf(value) !== -1)))))"}, {"question": "39.  ### How do you customize model directive for a component?", "answer": "", "code": "The v-model directive on a component uses **value** as the prop and **input** as the event, but some input types such as `checkboxes` and `radio buttons` may need to use the value attribute for a server side value. In this case, it is preferred to customize model directive.Let's take an example of checkbox component,Vue.component('custom-checkbox', (model: (prop: 'checked',event: 'change'),props: (checked: Boolean),template: `<inputtype=\"checkbox\"v-bind:checked=\"checked\"v-on:change=\"$emit('change', $event.target.checked)\">`))Now you can use v-model on this customized component as below,<custom-checkbox v-model=\"selectFramework\"></custom-checkbox>The selectFramework property will be passed to the checked prop and same property will be updated when custom checkbox component emits a change event with a new value."}, {"question": "40.  ### What are the possible ways to provide transitions?", "answer": "", "code": "There are many ways Vue provides transition effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM.Below are the possible ways,1. Automatically apply classes for CSS transitions and animations2. Integrate 3rd-party CSS animation libraries. For example, Animate.css3. Use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM during transition hooks4. Integrate 3rd-party JavaScript animation libraries. For example, Velocity.js"}, {"question": "41.  ### What is vue router and their features?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue Router is a official routing library for single-page applications designed for use with the Vue.js framework.Below are their features,1.

It rendered as an `<a>` tag --><router-link to=\"/home\">Home</router-link><router-link to=\"/services\">Services</router-link></p><!-- route outlet in which component matched by the route will render here --><router-view></router-view></div>**Step 2:** Import Vue and VueRouter packages and then apply routerimport Vue from 'vue';import VueRouter from 'vue-router';Vue.use(VueRouter)**Step 3:** Define or import route components.const Home = ( template: '<div>Home</div>' )const Services = ( template: '<div>Services</div>' )**Step 4:** Define your route where each one maps to a componentconst routes = [( path: '/home', component: Home ),( path: '/services', component: Services )]**Step 5:** Create the router instance and pass the `routes` optionconst router = new VueRouter((routes // short for `routes: routes`))**Step 6:**  Create and mount the root instance.const app = new Vue((router)).$mount('#app')Now you are able to navigate different pages(Home, Services) with in Vue application."}, {"question": "43.  ### What is dynamic route matching?", "answer": "", "code": "Sometimes it may be required to map routes to the same component based on a pattern.Let's take a user component with the mapped URLs like `/user/john/post/123` and `/user/jack/post/235` using dynamic segments,const User = (template: '<div>User (( $route.params.name )), PostId: (( route.params.postid ))</div>')const router = new VueRouter((routes: [// dynamic segments start with a colon( path: '/user/:name/post/:postid', component: User )]))"}, {"question": "44.  ### How to make router param changes as reactive?", "answer": "", "code": "When you navigate from one URL to other(mapped with a single component) using routes with params then the same component instance will be reused. Even though it is more efficient than destroying the old instance and then creating a new one, the lifecycle hooks of the component will not be called.This problem can be solved using either of the below approaches,1. **Watch the $route object:**const User = (template: '<div>User (( $route.params.name )) </div>',watch: ('$route' (to, from) (// react to route changes...)))2. **Use beforeRouteUpdate navigation guard:** This is only available since 2.2 version.const User = (template: '<div>User (( $route.params.name )) </div>',beforeRouteUpdate (to, from, next) (// react to route changes and then call next()))Note that the beforeRouteEnter guard does NOT have access to `this`. Instead you can pass a callback to `next` to access the vm instance."}, {"question": "45.  ### What is route matching priority?", "answer": "", "code": "Sometimes the URL might be matched by multiple routes and the confusion of which route need to be mapped is resolved by route matching priority. The priority is based on order of routes configuration. i.e, The route which declared first has higher priority.const router = new VueRouter((routes: [// dynamic segments start with a colon( path: '/user/:name', component: User ) // This route gets higher priority( path: '/user/:name', component: Admin )( path: '/user/:name', component: Customer )]))"}, {"question": "46.  ### What are nested routes?", "answer": "", "code": "Generally, the app is composed of nested components which are nested multiple levels deep. The segments of a URL corresponds to a certain structure of these nested components. To render components into the nested outlet, you need to use the `children` option in `VueRouter` constructor config.Let's take a user app composed of profile and posts nested components with respective routes. You can also define a default route configuration when there is no matching nested route.const router = new VueRouter((routes: [( path: '/user/:id', component: User,children: [(// UserProfile will be rendered inside User's <router-view> when /user/:id/profile is matchedpath: 'profile',component: UserProfile),(// UserPosts will be rendered inside User's <router-view> when /user/:id/posts is matchedpath: 'posts',component: UserPosts),// UserHome will be rendered inside User's <router-view> when /user/:id is matched(  path: '',component: UserHome ),])]))"}, {"question": "47.  ### What are single file components?", "answer": "", "code": "Single File Components are an easy concept to understand. Earlier you might heard about all three parts(HTML, JavaScript and CSS) of your application kept in different components. But Single File Components encapsulate the structure, styling and behaviour into one file. In the beginning, it seems strange to have all three parts in one file, but it actually makes a lot more sense.Let's take an example of Singile File Components<template><div><h1>Welcome (( name ))!</h1></div></template><script>module.exports = (data: function() (return (name: 'John')))</script><style scoped>h1 (color: #34c779;padding: 3px;)</style>"}, {"question": "48.  ### Is Single File Components violating separation of concerns?", "answer": "", "code": "As for the latest modern UI development, separation of concerns is not equal to separation of file types. So it is preferred to divide codebase layers into loosely-coupled components and compose them instead of dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweave with one another. This way makes Single File Components more cohesive and maintainable by combining template, logic and styles together inside a component.You can also still maintain javascript and CSS files separately with hot-reloading and pre-compilation features.For example,<template><div>This section will be pre-compiled and hot reloaded</div></template><script src=\"./my-component.js\"></script><style src=\"./my-component.css\"></style>"}, {"question": "49.  ### What are the problems solved by Single File Components?", "answer": "", "code": "The Single File Components solve the common problems occurred in a javascript driven application with a .vue extension. The list of issues are,1. Global definitions force unique names for every component2. String templates lack syntax highlighting and require ugly slashes for multiline HTML3. No CSS support means that while HTML and JavaScript are modularized into components, CSS is conspicuously left out4. No build step restricts us to HTML and ES5 JavaScript, rather than preprocessors like Pug (formerly Jade) and Babel."}, {"question": "50.  ### What are filters?", "answer": "", "code": "Filters can be used to apply common text formatting. These Filters should be appended to the end of the JavaScript expression, denoted by the \u201cpipe\u201d symbol. You can use them in two specific cases:1. mustache interpolations2. v-bind expressionsFor example, Let's define a local filter named capitalize in a component\u2019s optionsfilters: (capitalize: function (value) (if (!value) return ''value = value.toString()return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)))Now you can use the filter in either mustache interpolation or v-bind expression,<!-- in mustaches -->(( username | capitalize ))<!-- in v-bind --><div v-bind:id=\"username | capitalize\"></div>"}, {"question": "51.  ### What are the different ways to create filters?", "answer": "", "code": "You can define filters in two ways,1. **Local filters:**You can define local filters in a component\u2019s options. In this case, filter is applicable to that specific component.filters: (capitalize: function (value) (if (!value) return ''value = value.toString()return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)))2. **Global filters:**You can also define a filter globally before creating the Vue instance. In this case, filter is applicable to all the components with in the vue instance,Vue.filter('capitalize', function (value) (if (!value) return ''value = value.toString()return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1)))new Vue((// ...))"}, {"question": "52.  ### How do you chain filters?", "answer": "", "code": "You can chain filters one after the other to perform multiple manipulations on the expression. The generic structure of filter chain would be as below,(( message | filterA | filterB | filterB ... ))In the above chain stack, you can observe that message expression applied with three filters, each separated by a pipe(|) symbol. The first filter(filterA) takes the expression as a single argument and the result of the expression becomes an argument for second filter(filterB) and the chain continue for remaining filters.For example, if you want to transform date expression with a full date format and uppercase then you can apply dateFormat and uppercase filters as below,(( birthday | dateFormat | uppercase ))"}, {"question": "53.  ### Is it possible to pass parameters for filters?", "answer": "", "code": "Yes, you can pass arguments for a filter similar to a javascript function. The generic structure of filter parameters would be as follows,(( message | filterA('arg1', arg2) ))In this case, filterA takes message expression as first argument and the explicit parameters mentioned in the filter as second and third arguments.For example, you can find the exponential strength of a particular value(( 2 | exponentialStrength(10) )) <!-- prints 2 power 10 = 1024 -->"}, {"question": "54.  ### What are plugins and their various services?", "answer": "", "code": "Plugins provides global-level functionality to Vue application. The plugins provide various services,1. Add some global methods or properties. For example, vue-custom-element2. Add one or more global assets (directives, filters and transitions). For example, vue-touch3. Add some component options by global mixin. For example, vue-router4. Add some Vue instance methods by attaching them to Vue.prototype.5. A library that provides an API of its own, while at the same time injecting some combination of the above. For example, vue-router"}, {"question": "55.  ### How to create a plugin?", "answer": "", "code": "The Plugin is created by exposing an `install` method which takes Vue constructor as a first argument along with options.

These reusable functions are merged with existing functions. A mixin object can contain any component options. Let us take an example of mixin with `created` lifecycle which can be shared across components,const myMixin = (created()(console.log(\"Welcome to Mixins!\")))var app = new Vue((el: '#root',mixins: [myMixin]))**Note:** Multiple mixins can be specified in the mixin array of the component."}, {"question": "58.  ### What are global mixins?", "answer": "", "code": "Sometimes there is a need to extend the functionality of Vue or apply an option to all Vue components available in our application. In this case, mixins can be applied globally to affect all components in Vue. These mixins are called as global mixins.Let's take an example of global mixin,Vue.mixin((created()(console.log(\"Write global mixins\"))))new Vue((el: '#app'))In the above global mixin, the mixin options spread across all components with the console running during the instance creation. These are useful during test, and debugging or third party libraries. At the same time, You need to use these global mixins sparsely and carefully, because it affects every single Vue instance created, including third party components."}, {"question": "59.  ### How do you use mixins in CLI?", "answer": "", "code": "Using Vue CLI, mixins can be specified anywhere in the project folder but preferably within `/src/mixins` for ease of access. Once these mixins are created in a `.js` file and exposed with the `export` keyword, they can be imported in any component with the `import` keyword and their file paths."}, {"question": "60.  ### What are the merging strategies in mixins?", "answer": "", "code": "When a mixin and the component itself contain overlapping options, the options will be merged based on some strategies.1. The data objects undergo a recursive merge, with the component\u2019s data taking priority over mixins in cases of overlapping or conflicts.var mixin = (data: function () (return (message: 'Hello, this is a Mixin')))new Vue((mixins: [mixin],data: function () (return (message: 'Hello, this is a Component')),created: function () (console.log(this.$data); // => ( message: \"Hello, this is a Component'\" ))))2. The Hook functions which are overlapping merged into an array so that all of them will be called. Mixin hooks will be called before the component\u2019s own hooks.const myMixin = (created()(console.log(\"Called from Mixin\")))new Vue((el: '#root',mixins: [myMixin],created()(console.log(\"Called from Component\"))))// Called from Mixin// Called from Component3. The options that expect object values(such as methods, components and directives) will be merged into the same object. In this case, the component\u2019s options will take priority when there are conflicting keys in these objects.var mixin = (methods: (firstName: function () (console.log('John')),contact: function () (console.log('+65 99898987'))))var vm = new Vue((mixins: [mixin],methods: (lastName: function () (console.log('Murray')),contact: function () (console.log('+91 893839389')))))vm.firstName() // \"John\"vm.lastName() // \"Murray\"vm.contact() // \"+91 893839389\""}, {"question": "61.  ### What are custom options merging strategies?", "answer": "", "code": "Vue uses the default strategy which overwrites the existing value while custom options are merged.

Along with that, **update** and **componentUpdated** hooks expose `oldVnode`, to differentiate between the older value passed and the newer value. Below are the arguments passed to the hooks,1. `el`: The element the directive is bound to and it can be used to directly manipulate the DOM.2. `binding`: An object containing the following properties.1. `name`: The name of the directive, without the `v-` prefix.2. `value`: The value passed to the directive. For example in `v-my-directive=\"1 + 1\"`, the value would be 2.3. `oldValue`: The previous value, only available in update and componentUpdated. It is available whether or not the value has changed.4. `expression`: The expression of the binding as a string. For example in `v-my-directive=\"1 + 1\"`, the expression would be \"1 + 1\".5. `arg`: The argument passed to the directive, if any. For example in v-my-directive:foo, the arg would be \"foo\".6. `modifiers`: An object containing modifiers, if any. For example in v-my-directive.foo.bar, the modifiers object would be `( foo: true, bar: true )`.3. `vnode`: The virtual node produced by Vue\u2019s compiler.4. `oldVnode`: The previous virtual node, only available in the update and componentUpdated hooks.The arguments can be represented diagrammatically across the hooks as below,![custom-directives](images/custom-directives.svg)"}, {"question": "66.  ### How do you pass multiple values to a directive?", "answer": "", "code": "A directive can take any valid javascript expression.

Due to this reason, the full builds of VueJS application are not CSP complaint.In this case you can use **runtime-only** builds with Webpack + vue-loader or Browserify + vueify technology stack through which templates will be precompiled into render functions. This way you can make sure VueJS applications are 100% CSP complaint."}, {"question": "88.  ### What is the difference between full and runtime only builds?", "answer": "", "code": "There are two types of builds provided by VueJS,**1. Full:** These are the builds that contain both the compiler and the runtime.**2.

Normally you can use them for prototyping or learning purposes.For example, you can use them using jsdelivr with latest versions as below,<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.7/dist/vue.js\"></script>You can use it for native ES modules as below,<script type=\"module\">import Vue from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.7/dist/vue.esm.browser.js'</script>**Note:** You can remove version number to get latest version."}, {"question": "95.  ### How do you force update?", "answer": "", "code": "It is extremely rare situation of having to manually force an update despite the fact that no reactive data has changed. i.e, To force the Vue instance to re-render manually. You can do it force update using **vm.$forceUpdate()** API method.**Note:**  It does not affect all child components but only the instance itself and child components with inserted slot content."}, {"question": "96.  ### What is the purpose of vuejs once directive?", "answer": "", "code": "If you want to render `a lot of static content` then you need to make sure it only evaluated once and then cached thereafter. In this case, you can use `v-once` directive by wrapping at the root level.The example usage of v-once directive would be as below,Vue.component('legal-terms', (template: `<div v-once><h1>Legal Terms</h1>... a lot of static content goes here...</div>`))**Note:** It is recommended not to overuse unless there is slow rendering due to lot of static content."}, {"question": "97.  ### How do you access the root instance?", "answer": "", "code": "The root instance(new Vue()) can be accessed with the `$root` property.Let's see the usage of root instance with an example.First let's create a root instance with properties and methods as below,// The root Vue instancenew Vue((data: (age: 26),computed: (fullName: function () ( /* ... */ )),methods: (interest: function () ( /* ... */ ))))Now you can access root instance data and it's methods with in subcomponents as below,// Get root datathis.$root.age// Set root datathis.$root.age = 29// Access root computed propertiesthis.$root.fullName// Call root methodsthis.$root.interest()It is recommend using Vuex to manage state instead of using root instance as a global store."}, {"question": "98.  ### List out top 10 organizations using Vuejs?", "answer": "", "code": "Below are the top 10 organizations using VueJS for their applications or products,1.
